					Inspired by those big names (Einstein, Dirac, Feynman, etc.) in the history of physics, I was always determined to become a good theoretical physicist, exploring the mysterious physical nature to unravel the underlying principles. I followed this path and pursued this dream for the past decade. My goal was alway crystal clear: get a faculty position somewhere and build my own lab. This seems to be the best way to spend the rest of my life and doing academic research seems to be my destinied future.
				</p>

				<p>
					I started my research career after I got my Bachelor's degree in Beijing, 2007. I continued my master studies in China, working on theoretical atomic physics. As you may know that all elements found in nature were organized elegantly by periodic table. Some of them are located in the top rows of the table i.e. Hydrogen, Helium, we call them <q>light</q> elements. In contrast, those located in the bottom rows are <q>heavy</q> elements. The <q>light</q> and <q>heavy</q> are related to their corresponding atomic mass. We were more interested in those heavy elements which are usually radioactive and most of them can only be synthesized in lab. They have some peculiar features mainly because their nuclear charges are big, so the Coulomb interactions between the nucleus and surrounding electrons are so strong that could make the electron moves really fast and sometimes comparable to light speed. In this case, we have to consider the effect of special relativity which may change the electron obitals (usually inner obitals contract and outer ones expand). Such obital modification could make their physicochemical properties so different from other elements with similar electron structure. What I calculated was element 117 (number of charges) which was just produced in lab. Indeed our calculations show some interesting peculiar chemical properties and some of them were confirmed in CERN. Although NWNU is not a prestigious university even in China, this experience is more important than anything, including me later getting into MIT, cause I met my lovely wife there whom I have been married to for nearly 10 years and have two kids with : )

					Then I wanted to do something more interdisciplinary and in the meantime see the world outside China, so I applied the PhD position in biophysics at Lund University in Sweden. Luckily I got this position, working under professor Bertil Halle. At LU, I mainly studied protein dynamics using a spectroscopic technique called NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). You may have heard MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) which are widely used in hospital to scan human tissues. MRI is one application of NMR. For elementary particles like proton, neutron or electron, apart from electricity and mass, there is another property called spin, which behaves like angular momentum. In my PhD studies, I worked on quantum mechanical theories of water and protein protons, writing simulation packages to fit the experimental curve so we can determine those dynamic parameters like how much time protein molecule would tumble in solution, and how much time it changes its confirmation and unfold, things like that. We developed our theory based on a special model called EMOR. We started from the simplest model spin systems: 2-spin system, then 3-spin, then 4-spin, gradually built up our understanding of the increasing complexity and then extrapolated to the multi-spin systems. We published 5 papers on this project and the multi-spin paper contains more than 100 equations! It was a very difficult thesis project but I had a lot of fun. From this experience, I learned the importance of persistence and also how to solve a complex problem step by step, manage a project, and develop your own ideas.

					Then I went to MIT in 2018, working under professor Bob Griffin as a postdoc researcher. Soon after, I received a grant from Swedish research council which could support me for 3 years. At MIT, I worked on solid-state NMR and dynamic nuclear polarization which sounds similar but completely different from what I did in my PhD. The application is still bio-related but it is mainly structual calculation of the protein molecules. In Griffin's lab, people are working on all sorts of things: from mechanical engineering to biochemistry. For example, if you want to build a NMR probe (the main part of a spectrometer), you need to have the knowledge of microwave, transimitters, electronic design, and also some machinaries; you could make some diamond rotors that spin so fast which potentially give you insanely high-resolution spectroscopy, then you need to know how to drill holes on diamonds; you could work on structural studies of Amyloid fibrils which are directly related to Alzheimer's desease, then you need to prepare the bio-sample, measure the corresponding NMR spectroscopies, and assign all the peaks; or you could work on pulse sequence design, which is to develop a electromagnetic pulse sequence to manipulate the spins so they behave as you expected. This is what I have been doing, which involves theory and simulations, and subsequent validation on the spectrometer. I plan to get more involved in experiments, but in early 2020, it was covid-break in the US and MIT campus was closed. So quarantined/bored in my small apartment, I picked up my old theory hobby and learned a semi-quantum theory called average Hamiltonian theory from scratch and then use it to analyze and develop the pulse sequences. We have finished 2 manuscripts during this period. Three-year at MIT was an eye-opening experience, which was also a huge boost of my confidence. Here I not only met so many talented people, but more importantly, realized that life is full of possibilities and you should have the courage to listen to your inner voice to pursue your own dream, not wasting your time on other people's expectations.

					After over a decade (~13 yrs) in academia, I must admit that I enjoy doing research which I will continue do so, but I want to do some more "useful" research, work on something that have big impact on general audience, not something of only academic interests which can only be appreciated by a small group of experts. Compared to questions like "How does imaginary part of spectral density functions affect integral spin relaxation rates?" which is interesting, super-complicated, and in the meantime no one cares, I would more prefer to answer questions like "What is the reasonable price for this apartment?". That is why I want to move to industry. And I believe the computing skills and the general analytical capabilities one gets by working in the physical sciences is valued in many places. Given my theoretical background and strong belief in AI, data science/machine learning seems a good choice and so far I've enjoyed a lot working in this area. Please check out the projects I've been working on recently.
