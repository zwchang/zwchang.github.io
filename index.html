				I am a theoretical physicist who have just finished three-year postdoc work at the Department of Chemistry at MIT, USA. This position is mainly focused on developing novel methods to measure protein structures using a spectroscopic technique called solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
			<p>
				Influenced by some of my colleagues at MIT who use state-of-art machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze spectroscopy, I got very interested in this hot topic and started exploring this area. After learning/practicing more on this subject, I am convinced that no matter in academia or industry, AI is clearly the future. After some serious considerations, I decided to move into industry, solving real-life problems using big data. Now I am looking for positions as a data scientist.
			<p>
				I am currently working on several hobby data science projects, and one of them is a typical regression problem which involves scrapping data from the web. During that process I felt necessary to learn basic html structure and CSS so I could do the same job better in the future. After watching a few YouTube tutorials and a lot of searching in Google/stackoverflow, as a side project, I built this personal website from scratch over a weekend. This site is still under construction and I will keep updating, styling, adding more content and functionalities.
